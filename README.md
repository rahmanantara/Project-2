Second project for the SEG New Hire Training This is the final update An FPGA is set to SPI/PLL/IDD mode to conduct tests using IG-XL
Had some issues happen with the DSSC PLL and Frequency trim test
If there is a validation error, close ig-xl and open again. Nop the DSSC PLL test and try to validate.
